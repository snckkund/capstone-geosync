Points Discussed:

1. Sustainability factors that can reduce climate changes 
2. Working on how to reduce climate change.
3. How our project can help in detection of climate change.
4. Future trends of a particular place that is going to be affected by climate change 
5. Making Research Papers, so that we can show it as proof of our project.

# Geospatial Analysis to identify Climate Change

- using Google Earth Engine and ML models
- To identify climate change and track accurate weather forecasting
- Analysing (long term / short term trends)
- - temp. 
- - precipitation
- - etc...

## Tools
- GEE 
- - JS API
- - Python API
- Access Satellite images
- - LAndsat
- - MODIS
- Fetching datasets
- - climate
- - weather
- - temp.
- - etc...

## ML Libraries
- Tensorflow (Building and training models)
- Scikit-learn (Regression)
- Pytorch (ML model development)

## Measuring model Accuracy / Performance
- RMSE
- MAE
- R2

## Additional
- Matplotlib (for creating Visualizations in python)
- GEE Virtualization tools (for mapping and time-series plots
-  - CNN
- - LSTM / ARIMA

## Development Environment
- Jupyter Notebook (DA and model development)
- Google collab (to run GEE resources)
- Vs code for coding

## Datasets
- from GEE Data Catalogue
- ISRO dataset for climate and weather data

## Proof of work
### Finally deploy to the server and making frontend and backend 
- For deploying
- - REST API for model fetching
- - setting up  backend server
- - frontend using React
- - using Google maps API for maps
- - Adding all necessary things
